# üîå Custom Service Integration Guide

This guide shows how to integrate a new civic domain service into the CivicMind AI platform, covering both API service creation and MCP agent development.

## üìã Overview

We'll create a **Public Health Service** that handles:
- üè• Health department services
- ü¶† Disease outbreak reporting  
- üíâ Vaccination information
- üèÉ Public health programs
- üçé Food safety inspections

## üèóÔ∏è Integration Architecture

## üß™ Step 7: Testing Your Integration

### Test Health Service Integration

```bash

### Verify Service Registration

```bash

## üéâ Congratulations!

You've successfully integrated a complete **Public Health Service** into the CivicMind AI platform with:

‚úÖ **Complete API Service** with health-specific endpoints  
‚úÖ **AI-Powered MCP Agent** with domain expertise  
‚úÖ **Seamless Platform Integration** via API Gateway  
‚úÖ **Production-Ready Deployment** configurations  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing** and monitoring  
‚úÖ **Domain-Specific Intelligence** for health services  

Your Public Health Service can now handle:
- üè• **Health Inspections** - Restaurant and facility inspections
- ü¶† **Disease Reporting** - Communicable disease surveillance  
- üíâ **Vaccination Services** - Clinic finder and requirements
- üèÉ **Health Programs** - Public health program matching
- üåø **Environmental Health** - Air quality and environmental monitoring

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Expand Capabilities** - Add more health domain features
2. **Real Data Integration** - Connect to actual health department systems
3. **Mobile Interface** - Build citizen-facing mobile app
4. **Analytics Dashboard** - Create health analytics and reporting
5. **Multi-Language Support** - Add translation capabilities

This guide demonstrates how the CivicMind AI platform's modular architecture enables rapid development and deployment of new civic service domains while maintaining consistency and leveraging shared infrastructure.
